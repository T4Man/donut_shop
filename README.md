//Refactored most of the code.
//Code now pushes hourly calculations to array and uses a 'total' variable to increase the total each time an hourly calculation is made.
//Added a form with submit button to capture user input to add a new store.
//Added a condition to make sure no form fields are empty.
//Added a 'delete last row' button.
//Changed to a 'forEach' from 'for loop' to itereate through the static data arrays.
